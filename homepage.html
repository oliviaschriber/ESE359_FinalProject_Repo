Marjorie  Taylor  Greene,  R-Ga.,  leaves  the  Capitol  Hill  Club  in  Washington  on  Wednesday,  July  20,  2022.  (Bill  Clark/CQ-Roll  Call,  Inc  via  Getty  Images)Bill  Clark/Getty  ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailSave  StoryTo  revist  this  article,  visit  My  Profile,  then  View  saved  stories.Like  many  of  her  GOP  colleagues,  Marjorie  Taylor  Greene  is  an  antiabortion  zealot  who  does  not  believe  that  pregnant  people  should  get  to  decide  what  they  can  and  cannot  do  with  their  own  bodies.  Something  else  she  apparently  believes?  That  if  you’re  over  childbearing  age,  you  don’t  have  the  right  to  weigh  in  on  reproductive  rights  and  advocate  for  the  people  currently  being  harmed  by  the  Republican  Party.During  a  call-in  show  on  Monday  night,  Greene  was  confronted  by  a  woman  who  told  her,  “My  body  is  my  body  and  I  don’t  want  the  government  telling  me  what  I  can  do  with  my  body.”  Based  on  her  voice  alone,  the  caller  sounded  like  she  might  be  elderly  and  while  her  age  is  obviously  not  relevant,  Greene  insisted  it  was.  “Ma’am,  are  you  having  children  any  time  soon?”  she  asked,  not  pausing  for  an  answer.  “That’s  my  question,  I’m  asking  a  legitimate  question.”  She  then  went  on  to  insist  that  “abortion  is  murder”  before  circling  back  to  her  premise  that  the  caller  should  not  get  to  express  her  opinion  because  she  possibly  no  longer  ovulates.  “I  don’t  think  you’re  having  children  any  time  soon,”  Greene  said.  “So  I  appreciate  your  interest  in  women’s  rights  but  killing  an  unborn  baby  is  not  a  woman’s  right  and  that’s  not  health  care.”After  the  caller  appeared  to  reference  the  10-year-old  who  was  raped  in  Ohio  and  had  to  go  out  of  state  to  get  an  abortion,  Greene  told  her:  “That  is  a  very  rare,  rare,  rare  occasion  so  that  should  not  be  the  entire  premise  of  the  argument  on  abortion.  Again  ma’am,  I  know  you  say  it’s  your  body  your  choice  but  I  don’t  think  you’re  having  any  children  any  time  soon  and  I  think  we  need  to  focus  on  the  future  of  America  and  that’s  our  children…and  the  unborn,  they’re  our  future  also.  So  let’s  focus  on  protecting  their  lives  instead  of  being  focused  on  the  lie  that  abortion  is  women’s  health  care  because  that’s  not  health  care.”Twitter  contentThis  content  can  also  be  viewed  on  the  site  it  originates  from.Interestingly  Greene  has  never  suggested  that  the  male  politicians  who  have  restricted  abortion  access  and  want  to  pass  a  national  abortion  ban,  who  also  will  not  be  “having  children  any  time  soon,”  shouldn’t  be  allowed  to  weigh  in  here.Greene  has  previously  said  the  overturning  of  Roe  v.  Wade  was  a  “blessing”  and  a  “miracle,”  and  called  another  Republican  lawmaker  and  rape  survivor  “trash”  for  supporting  rape  exceptions.  She’s  also  told  women  that  if  they  don’t  want  to  get  pregnant  they  should  “make  better  choices”  and  “choose  to  not  have  sex.”  (She  did  not  mention  that  abstinence  is  apparently  not  something  she  personally  practices,  if  a  report  from  last  year—which  featured  allegations  that  the  lawmaker  had  multiple  affairs  with  guys  she  met  at  the  gym,  one  of  whom  was  reportedly  a  “polyamorous  tantric-sex  guru”—is  anything  to  go  by.  (Greene,  for  her  part,  has  called  the  report  “ridiculous  tabloid  garbage.”)In  other  abortion  news,  Fox  News  host  Tucker  Carlson  claimed  on  his  show  last  night  that  Democrats  are  passionate  about  abortion  because  they  are  part  of  a  “child-sacrifice  cult,”  which  not  only  has  the  distinction  of  being  completely  insane  but  a  nice  little  piece  of  red  meat  for  the  QAnon  crowd.Most  PopularKari  Lake's  Response  to  Arizona's  Election  Results  Couldn't  Be  More  TrumpianBy  Eric  LutzTrump  Freaks  Out  Republicans  With  Threat  to  Announce  2024  Bid  Before  Election  DayBy  Bess  LevinReport:  Trump  Is  Blaming  Everyone  but  Himself  for  the  Midterms.

Per  USA  Today:Hope  Hicks,  once  a  top  aide  to  former  president  Donald  Trump,  met  Tuesday  for  an  interview  with  the  House  committee  investigating  the  Capitol  attack  on  Jan.  6,  2021,  according  to  reports  from  The  New  York  Times,  CNN,  and  NBC.  Hicks  was  one  of  the  earliest  staffers  on  Trump’s  presidential  campaign  and  served  in  the  White  House  as  his  communications  director.  She  left  the  administration  in  2018  for  Fox  News,  but  returned  in  February  2020  for  Trump’s  final  year  in  office.  Hicks  was  among  the  aides  who  told  Trump  that  he  lost  the  2020  election  even  as  he  continued  to  fight  the  results,  according  to  several  books  written  about  the  administration  cited  by  CNN.While  Hicks  might  have  indeed  been  among  those  who  refused  to  indulge  Trump’s  election  conspiracies—the  former  president  would  reportedly  declare  in  postelection  White  House  meetings,  “Hope  doesn’t  believe  in  me,”  to  which  the  aide  would  respond,  “No,  I  don’t“—it’s  not  clear  how  helpful  her  testimony  might  be  or  what  she  might  be  willing  to  reveal.  In  addition  to  being  fiercely  loyal  to  Trump  during  his  time  in  office,  she  made  it  clear  that  her  resignation  days  before  the  end  of  Trump’s  term  was  not  about  the  insurrection  Trump  had  incited;  according  to  reporting  at  the  time,  it  was  merely  “part  of  planned  departure  and  normal  drift  away  at  the  end  of  an  administration.”Most  PopularKari  Lake's  Response  to  Arizona's  Election  Results  Couldn't  Be  More  TrumpianBy  Eric  LutzTrump  Freaks  Out  Republicans  With  Threat  to  Announce  2024  Bid  Before  Election  DayBy  Bess  LevinReport:  Trump  Is  Blaming  Everyone  but  Himself  for  the  Midterms.
